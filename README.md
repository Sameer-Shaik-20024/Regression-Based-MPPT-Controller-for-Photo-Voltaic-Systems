# Regression Based MPPT Controller for Photo-Voltaic Systems



This research project focused on developing and evaluating an intelligent Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller for solar PV systems using **Multi-Linear Regression (MLR)**. The aim was to optimize the efficiency of a DC-DC boost converter under varying irradiance and temperature conditions.
